# S_Hacks2020

We built an Android app feature which helps Small and Medium-sized Enterprises summarise their financial data and calculate KPIs such as gross profit margin and liquidity ratios. We built the product by parsing banking data on an excel sheet, using Natural Language Processing to tag all the key business-related terms using NER tagging, importing this all into Android Studio, and building UX/UI using Marvel. The documentation for Stanford's Java NLP library can be found inside the nlp folder.

We made a demo video with a pitch that you can view once you open the project folder above
